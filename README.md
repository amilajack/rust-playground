# rust-playground

This repository shows some example of rust code for common coding
problems. As rust is different from other programming languages,
this is useful to have some patterns and code examples to translate
what we know in this new paradigm.


## Traits
 * **src/animals.rs** shows a very basic example of how to define traits
 when defining a new structure Animals.
 * **src/tree.rs** is a quick implementation of a binary tree with rust.
 * **src/threads-unsafe.rs** is a use of threads with unsafe operations (use 
   of a global variable being modified).
